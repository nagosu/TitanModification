                <p class="qst-txt">Empathy is frequently listed as one of the most desired skills in an employer or
                  employee, although
                  without specifying exactly what is meant by empathy. Some businesses stress cognitive empathy,
                  emphasizing
                  the need for leaders to understand the perspective of employees and customers when negotiating deals and
                  making decisions. Others stress affective empathy and empathic concern, emphasizing the ability of
                  leaders
                  to gain trust from employees and customers by treating them with real concern and compassion. When some
                  consultants argue that successful companies foster empathy, what that translates to is that companies
                  should conduct good market research. In other words, an “empathic” company understands the needs and
                  wants
                  of its customers and seeks to fulfill those needs and wants. When some people speak of design with
                  empathy, what that translates to is that companies should take into account the specific needs of
                  different populations — the blind, the deaf, the elderly, non­English speakers, the color­blind, and so
                  on
                  — when designing products.</p>

                <p class="qst-txt">The realization of human domination over the environment began in the late 1700s with
                  the industrial revolution. Advances in manufacturing transformed societies and economies while producing
                  significant impacts on the environment. American society became structured on multiple industries’
                  capitalistic goals as the development of the steam engine led to the mechanized production of goods in
                  mass quantities. Rural agricultural communities with economies based on handmade goods and agriculture
                  were abandoned for life in urban cities with large factories based on an economy of industrialized
                  manufacturing. Innovations in the production of textiles, iron, and steel provided increased profits to
                  private companies. Simultaneously, those industries exerted authority over the environment and began
                  dumping hazardous by­products in public lands and waterways.</p>

                  If you had wanted to create a “self-driving” car in the 1950s, your best option might have been to strap
                  a brick to the accelerator. Yes, the vehicle would have been able to move forward on its own, but it
                  could not slow down, stop, or turn to avoid barriers. Obviously not ideal. But does that mean the entire
                  concept of the self-driving car is not worth pursuing? No, it only means that at the time we did not yet
                  have the tools we now possess to help enable vehicles to operate both autonomously and safely. This
                  once-distant dream now seems within our reach. It is much the same
                  story in medicine. Two decades ago, <b>(we were still taping bricks to accelerators.)</b> Today, we are
                  approaching the point where we can begin to bring some appropriate technology to bear in ways that
                  advance our understanding of patients as unique individuals. In fact, many patients are already wearing
                  devices that monitor their conditions in real time, which
                  allows doctors to talk to their patients in a specific, refined, and feedback-driven way that was not
                  even possible a decade ago.

                <p class="qst-txt">We must explore the relationship between children’s film production and consumption
                  habits. The term “children’s film” implies ownership by children — their cinema — but films supposedly
                  made for children have always been <span class="txt-bd"></span>, particularly in commercial
                  cinemas. The considerable crossover in audience composition for children’s films can be shown by the
                  fact that, in 2007, eleven Danish children’s and youth films attracted 59 per cent of theatrical
                  admissions, and in 2014, German children’s films comprised seven out of the top twenty films at the
                  national box office. This phenomenon corresponds with a broader, international embrace of what is
                  seemingly children’s culture among audiences of diverse ages. The old prejudice that children’s film is
                  some other realm, separate from (and forever subordinate to) a more legitimate cinema for adults is not
                  supported by the realities of consumption: children’s film is at the heart of contemporary popular
                  culture.</p>

                  Dancers often push themselves to the limits of their physical capabilities. But that push is misguided
                  if it is directed toward accomplishing something physically impossible. For instance, a tall dancer with
                  long feet may wish to perform repetitive vertical jumps to fast music, pointing his feet while in the
                  air and lowering his heels to the floor between jumps. That may be impossible no matter how strong the
                  dancer is. But a short­footed dancer may have no trouble! Another dancer may be struggling to complete a
                  half­turn in the air. Understanding the connection between a rapid turn rate and the alignment of the
                  body close to the rotation axis tells her how to accomplish her turn successfully. In both of these

                  shape, but they can pay less attention to location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an

                  simple implement that has transformed a fundamental human experience for vast numbers of infants and
                  mothers, yet it finds no place in our histories of technology. This technology might be thought of as a
                  classic time­shifting device, as it enables mothers to exercise more control over the timing of feeding.
                  It can also function to save time, as bottle feeding allows for someone else to substitute for the
                  mother’s time. Potentially, therefore, it has huge implications for the management of time in everyday
                  life, yet it is entirely overlooked in discussions of high­speed society.

                  Too many times people, especially in today’s generation, expect things to just happen overnight. When we
                  have these false expectations, it tends to discourage us from continuing to move forward. Because this
                  is a high tech society, everything we want has to be within the parameters of our comfort and
                  convenience. If it doesn’t happen fast enough, we’re tempted to lose interest. So many people don’t want
                  to take the time it requires to be successful. Success is not a matter of mere desire; you should
                  develop patience in order to achieve it. Have you fallen prey to impatience? Great things take time to

                  Christine was a cat owner who loved her furry companion, Leo. One morning, she noticed that Leo was not
                  feeling well. Concerned for her beloved cat, Christine decided to take him to the animal hospital. As
                  she always brought Leo to this hospital, she was certain that the vet knew well about Leo. <b>(A)
                    She</b>
                  desperately hoped Leo got the necessary care as soon as possible.
                  The waiting room was filled with other pet owners. Finally, it was Leo’s turn to see the vet. Christine
                  watched as the vet gently examined him. The vet said, “<b>(B) I</b> think Leo has a minor infection.”
                  “Infection? Will he be okay?” asked Christine. “We need to do some tests to see if he is infected. But
                  for the tests, it’s best for Leo to stay here,” replied the vet. It was heartbreaking for Christine to
                  leave Leo at the animal hospital, but <b>(C) she</b> had to accept it was for the best.
                  “I’ll call <b>(D) you</b> with updates as soon as we know anything,” said the vet. Throughout the day,
                  Christine anxiously awaited news about Leo. Later that day, the phone rang and it was the vet. “The
                  tests revealed a minor infection. Leo needs some medication and rest, but he'll be back to his playful
                  self soon.” Relieved to hear the news, Christine rushed back to the animal hospital to pick up Leo.
                  The vet provided detailed instructions on how to administer the medication and shared tips for a speedy
                  recovery. Back at home, Christine created a comfortable
                  space for Leo to rest and heal. <b>(E) She</b> patted him with love and attention, ensuring that he
                  would
                  recover in no time. As the days passed, Leo gradually regained his strength and playful spirit.

                  We are the only species that seasons its food, deliberately altering it with the highly flavored plant
                  parts we call herbs and spices. It’s quite possible that our taste for spices has an evolutionary root.
                  <b>(1)</b> Many spices have antibacterial properties — in fact, common seasonings such as garlic, onion,
                  and
                  oregano inhibit the growth of almost every bacterium tested. <b>(2)</b> And the cultures that make the
                  heaviest
                  use of spices — think of the garlic and black pepper of Thai food, the ginger and coriander of India,
                  the chili peppers of Mexico — come from warmer climates, where bacterial spoilage is a bigger issue.
                  <b>(3)</b>
                  The changing climate can have a significant impact on the production and availability of spices,
                  influencing their growth patterns and ultimately affecting global spice markets. <b>(4)</b> In contrast,
                  the
                  most lightly spiced cuisines — those of Scandinavia and northern Europe — are from cooler climates.
                  <b>(5)</b>
                  Our uniquely human attention to flavor, in this case the flavor of spices, turns out to have arisen as a
                  matter of life and death.

                  the United States to advise engineers on the design of a wind tunnel at California Institute of
                  Technology (Caltech). He became the director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech in
                  1930. Later, he was awarded the National Medal of Science for his leadership in science and engineering.

                  Gordon Parks was a photographer, author, film director, and musician. He documented the everyday lives
                  of African Americans at a time when few people outside the black community were familiar with their
                  lives. Parks was born the youngest of 15 children and grew up on his family’s farm. After the death of
                  his mother, he went to live with a sister in Minnesota. Parks eventually dropped out of school and
                  worked at various jobs. His interest in photography was inspired by a photo­essay he read about migrant
                  farm workers. After he moved to Chicago, Parks began taking photos of poor African Americans. In 1949,
                  he became the first African American to be a staff photographer for Life magazine. He also wrote music
                  pieces in his life and in 1956 the Vienna Orchestra performed a piano concerto he wrote. Parks was an
                  inspiring artist until he died in 2006.

                  Emotion socialization — learning from other people about emotions and how to deal with them — starts
                  early in life and plays a foundational role for emotion regulation development. Although extra­familial
                  influences, such as peers or media, gain in importance during adolescence, parents remain the <b>[1]
                    primary</b> socialization agents. For example, their own responses to emotional situations serve as a

                  model for emotion regulation, increasing the likelihood that their children will show <b>[2] similar</b>
                  reactions in comparable situations. Parental practices at times when their children are faced with
                  emotional challenges also impact emotion regulation development. Whereas direct soothing and directive

                  The fast­growing, tremendous amount of data, collected and stored in large and numerous data
                  repositories, has far exceeded our human ability for understanding without powerful tools. As a result,
                  data collected in large data repositories become “data tombs” — data archives that are hardly visited.
                  Important decisions are often made based not on the information–rich data stored in data repositories
                  but rather on a decision maker’s instinct, simply because the decision maker does not have the tools to
                  extract the valuable knowledge hidden in the vast amounts of data. Efforts have been made to develop
                  expert system and knowledge­based technologies, which typically rely on users or domain experts to
                  manually input knowledge into knowledge bases. However, this procedure is likely to
                  cause biases and errors and is extremely costly and time consuming. The widening gap between data and
                  information calls for the systematic development of tools that can turn data tombs into “golden nuggets”
                  of knowledge.

                  “Craftsmanship” may suggest a way of life that declined with the arrival of industrial society ― but
                  this is misleading. Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well
                  for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the computer
                  programmer, the doctor, and the artist; parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, as
                  does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in
                  itself. Social and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way of the craftsman’s discipline
                  and commitment: schools may fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces may not truly
                  value the aspiration for quality. And though craftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of
                  pride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman often faces conflicting objective standards of
                  excellence; the desire to do something well for its own sake can be weakened by competitive pressure, by
                  frustration, or by obsession.

                  Trends constantly suggest new opportunities for individuals to restage themselves, representing

                  costumery.
                  Clothes are part of how people present <b>(B) them</b> to the world, and fashion locates them in the

                  relative to what is happening in society and to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion
                  contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the meanings <b>(C) associated</b> with
                  specific pieces of clothing. Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of self-expression:

                <p class="qst-txt">The most prevalent problem kids report is that they feel like they need to be
                  accessible at all times. Because technology allows for it, they feel an obligation. It’s easy for most
                  of us to relate — you probably feel the same pressure in your own life! It is really challenging to deal
                  with the fact that we’re human and can’t always respond instantly. For a teen or tween who’s still
                  learning the ins and outs of social interactions, it’s even worse. Here’s how this behavior plays out
                  sometimes: Your child texts one of his friends, and the friend doesn’t text back right away. Now it’s
                  easy for your child to think, “This person doesn’t want to be my friend anymore!” So he texts again, and
                  again, and again — “blowing up their phone.” This can be stress­inducing and even read as aggressive.
                  But you can see how easily this could happen.</p>
